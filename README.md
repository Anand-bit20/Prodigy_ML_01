# Linear Regression for House Price Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model for predicting house prices based on features such as living area, the number of bedrooms, and the number of full bathrooms. It uses Python and scikit-learn library for the machine learning part.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install these packages using pip: pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

### Download the Dataset:

You'll need the "train.csv" dataset to run the code. Make sure you have this CSV file in the same directory as your Python script or Jupyter Notebook.

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the "train.csv" dataset and place it in the project directory.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the linear regression model and make predictions.
4. Explore the scatter plot to visualize the model's performance.

### Data

The dataset used for this project is "train.csv," which contains the following columns:

- GrLivArea: Above-grade (ground) living area square feet
- BedroomAbvGr: Number of bedrooms above grade
- FullBath: Number of full bathrooms above grade
- SalePrice: Sale price of the house

### Model Evaluation

The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to evaluate the model's performance on the test data. A lower MSE indicates better predictive accuracy.

### Run the Code:

You can run the code using a Python script or a Jupyter Notebook, depending on how it was originally written.
- Using a Python Script: If the code is in a Python script (a .py file), open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where your script is located.
- Run the script using Python: python your_script_name.py
- Replace your_script_name.py with the actual name of your Python script file.
- To run this file use this in your terminal : python linear_regression.py
